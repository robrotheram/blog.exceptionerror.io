Its been over 3 months since the last blog post. Where I mentioned some of project ideas I was planning on working on. Out of the 3 projects( Golang/React Project, Sentiment Analysis, Cluster Architecture) I have done about 1 and 1/2 of them so not that bad. I ended up dropping the IRC  Sentiment Analysis partly  because my data source (Gamealtion IRC Chat) dried up as moved over to Discord (which might be another topic to post on), and other time commitments. But I did complete the Golang/React Project and did some other work on Cluster architectures not as much as I would like but its such a diverse topic you could spend years on it.

For more infomation about the  Golang/React you can read my adventures with it [here.](https://blog.robrotheram.com/2017/07/16/my-adventurers-with-go-angular/) 
I also have written up a bit with my experimentation with an ELK Stack, you can see that [here](https://blog.robrotheram.com/2017/07/15/elk-stack/)



######Where have I been

Also In the past few months I taken a couple of different trips the first was to London where tried to get some interesting shots form around the finacial sector. These include some of the more iconic London architecture such as the Gerkin.

More can been seen in the [London 2017 Album](https://gallery.robrotheram.com/albums/london-2017/)

Another place was a trip to  Mid and North Wales which has some amazing landscapes and architecture if the weather holds sadly for me it was very overcast so not the most greatest conditions to take picturesque photos. But I made the most of it
