God Dam it Micorsoft fine just take my money!  

The story starts last month when one of my parents fell for one of the gift card scammers email. To be fair to my parents the hacker did not compromised there account, I have tried to get them to use good password quaility.  What the scammers did was compromised their friend accound and send the email. Being unsure, my parent sent a email confirming the giftcard to their friend second account, which was good thining. But the scammer being extra crafty they also compromised their friend sceond account so when my prarent sent a email to the second account the scammer also responded prendting to be their friend.  Being busy at work my parent fell for it and baught and send the gift card.  Now down Â£100 and their pride I got some problems to solve. 

My parents are currently in their mid 60's about to enter retirements and while I would not class them as a digital native I think we could call them at least digital fluent. For the most all I do is a once a year PC / Phone checkup to make sure all is working well. 

I had a Grandparent that has a ipad and I would call having a basic grasp but as I whatched over the years while they once could pick the occasional new think like switching form PC to IPad they are now at the point that new things e.g Whatsapp is now beyond them. 

Seeing all of this I need a solution to be able to manage my parents Online presents that can start off as a mostly hands off approach but with controls that I can use to have a more envoled as they get older. The security landscape is also changing after the above incident they now have 2FA enabled on all accounts. But that comes with a new challenge they live 3 hours away so if a problem occures I can not just come to their house to sort it out and now with 2FA I can't just log into their account from my house, well not without being on the phone which as all tech support people know is not a fun experience that I want to minimise.

The world is moving on and now most things are online only to mange things as phone support becomes less a normaility and also the world is  multi device. When once it was just the familiy PC each person has at least one laptop and phone so that is 4 device just for my 2 parents alone. That does not include tablets smart watches and I currenty think thank god there is no smart home stuff. But I wont be long until that may become a normaility, urg.  

The final problem is more of a prediction I can see in the future. Looking at some of the new applications/services that are comming out in the last year or so e.g TailScale. They are not wanting to manage users/passwords (understandabled) so are offloading the responsiblity to third party idenity services. You know the ones, the login with Google, Microsoft etc. While some do support other idenitiy services they require Enterprise level accounts which for 4-5 people in total is no worth it. 

I do not want a 2nd Job as the Family Tech Support that now elevated as a Enterprise admin.
